### Description

The Coffee Shop "Espresso Dreams"

This webpage shows my skils thus far in HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.  

The first page is a mock landing page.  There is a popup to subscribe in order to receive 10%.  

From there you can click the world gif to travel to the shopping center.  There you can check prices, and type.  As well as view locations in the area to buy coffee. 

The last page is the shopping cart checkout.  Here you can check out at your convience, and add a donation.
