### Description

The Coffee Shop

This webpage shows my skils thus far in HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.  The first page is a mock landing page of a bio.  From there you can travel to the shopping center where you can check prices, type, ratings, and comments.  As well as comment yourself.  The last page is the cart where you can check out at your convience.  Still currently working.
